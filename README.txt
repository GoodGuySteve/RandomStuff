Wildstar Simulations (under Project 1)
  This project is currently highly unfinished. It's purpose is to simulate the usage of skills and abilities
  in a video game for analytical purposes. Ideally, this tool will be able to help players understand how
  best to use their skills and how to modify their character to perform better.
